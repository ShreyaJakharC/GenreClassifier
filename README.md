# GenreClassifier

As part of my capstone project in Machine Learning, I developed a model to predict the genre of songs using audio features provided by Spotifyâ€™s API. This project involved working with a real-world dataset of 50,000 songs, tackling challenges such as handling missing data, performing dimensionality reduction, and managing multi-class classification.

## Key Highlights:
- Data Preprocessing: Transformed and cleaned the dataset, handling missing values and converting categorical data into a numerical format.
- Model Development: Built a robust classification model incorporating techniques like SVM, decision trees, and neural networks.
- Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering: Applied PCA and clustering to improve classification performance.
- Evaluation: Achieved a high AUC score, with a detailed analysis and visualizations, including ROC curves and genre clustering.

This project not only honed my machine learning skills but also provided valuable insights into solving real-world data challenges.
